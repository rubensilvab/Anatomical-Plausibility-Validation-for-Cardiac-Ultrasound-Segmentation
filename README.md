# POCUS Check A2C View-Segmentation Anatomical Plausibility
 Most of the current AI anatomical segmentation methods can generate segmentations without anatomical plausibility. This code help to check if the predicted segmentation is anatomical plausible. Developed for cardiac segmentation structures in A2C View.
